It's an arbitrary age; their brains are still developing, they're still figuring out what they want to do in life, and they often need to learn how to do basic things, like feed themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2000, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett published a paper arguing that there's a distinct era between ages 18 to 25 that is neither adolescence or adulthood. He dubbed it \"emerging adulthood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nEmerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life's possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course. … Emerging adults tend to have a wider scope of possible activities than persons in other age periods because they are less likely to be con- strained by role requirements, and this makes their demographic status unpredictable.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nArnett wasn't the first to think up this idea. He cited German psychoanalyze Erik Erikson, who wrote about the \"psychosocial moratorium\" that developed countries give to young people. It's a period \"during which the young adult through free role experimentation may find a niche in some section of his society.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut lots of teens never get to have a period of emerging adulthood, which tends to happen in college.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of them are forced to jump straight into the workforce, or they're in the painful limbo between high school and, well, whatever comes after.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last TK years, Arnett argues that emerging adults have delayed adulthood.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore people are going to college:\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople are getting married later in life:\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd people are having kids later in life:\r\n\r\n\r\nSo most of these kids have plenty of time.
