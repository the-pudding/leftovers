He dubbed it \"emerging adulthood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nEmerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life's possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course. … Emerging adults tend to have a wider scope of possible activities than persons in other age periods because they are less likely to be con- strained by role requirements, and this makes their demographic status unpredictable.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nArnett wasn't the first to think up this idea.
