It's an arbitrary age; their brains are still developing, they're still figuring out what they want to do in life, and they often need to learn how to do basic things, like feed themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In 2000, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett published a paper arguing that there's a distinct era between ages 18 to 25 that is neither adolescence or adulthood. He dubbed it "emerging adulthood."</p><p></p><p></p><p><blockquote></p><p>Emerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life's possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course. … Emerging adults tend to have a wider scope of possible activities than persons in other age periods because they are less likely to be con- strained by role requirements, and this makes their demographic status unpredictable.</p><p></blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>Arnett wasn't the first to think up this idea. He cited German psychoanalyze Erik Erikson, who wrote about the "psychosocial moratorium" that developed countries give to young people.

People around me were liberal – people I thought were good, smart people – so I absorbed their politics. And eventually I ended up reporting on politics.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To be honest, it was miserable. Politics is important, but talking to people who care about politics was completely uninteresting. I could predict their answers, their complaints, their frustrations.
